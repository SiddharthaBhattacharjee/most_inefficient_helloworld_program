## Inspiration
MLH LHD Challenge to make a useless hack.
## What it does
It prints hello world. The code that every coder has written at least once in their life, but we made it much more useless and inefficient. It has a list of all characters out of which it chooses randomly and matches with another list which has the hello world characters one by one, then prints each stage of the process, the cherry on top, it does it 1000 times(prints only once) and finds the average no. of turns it takes to print hello world using this method. I don't know if anyone needs to know this information, It's Useless. Wait, there is more, it also instead of adding the turns on a variable and deciding by 1000, it writes each value of the number of turns in a text file and then reads it back while calculating the average.
## How we built it
This app was built using python and a bunch of dumb ideas.
## Challenges we ran into
I accidentally made it a bit less inefficient at first : )
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This app serves a purpose that no one on the planet asked for.
## What we learned
How not to code.
## What's next for the useless and very inefficient Hello world program
Maybe put the lists in the cloud so that it needs to access them from the cloud for each iteration.
